**Describe the bug**  
The login/sign-up form does not submit correctly and the close button (âœ–) on the modal/dialog does not work as expected. Clicking it does nothing.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the homepage
2. Click on the login/sign-up button
3. Try submitting the form or click the close (X) button
4. Observe that no action happens or nothing closes

**Expected behavior**
- The form should either submit data or validate inputs with proper feedback.
- The modal should close when the close button is clicked.
